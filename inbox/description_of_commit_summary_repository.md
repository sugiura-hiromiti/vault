first, let me explain this repository. this repository has collection of commit summary which is of my github repositories. each commit summary is generated for certain range of commit history of the repository. each html files in the doc/ are a summary one by one. the file name of the summary follows certain format. it's "<repository name>_<year>_<month>_<day>_<hour>_<minute>_<second>.html". this repository has remote repository on github. we use github pages to deploy our summaries. index.html is the entrypoint of the deployed web page. index.html should be a powerful search hub and dashboard of statistics. read the entire repository and understand current index.html. then tell me every questions, suggestions and ideas of improving index.html

I'll reply your questions at first. 1: lack of content analysis is purely due to lack of time to implement. thus, the answer is we need, of course. 2: we're currently focusing on metadata searching framework. therefore, the priority of full-text search is low. 3: that's great. github integration is necessary part of this project. use it positively. 4: we actually not concern about performance. it's a future task. however, pagination is nice just for better UI/UX, I think. 5: this is also a future task. Now, let me reply your suggestions 1: please tell me precisely the difference of your suggesting code and current one. 2: all functionalities you suggested for advanced analytics dashboard is excellent. let's implement it. there might be duplication with current site's functionality. when you notice it. tell me everything. it would be better to decide the plan there. 3: smart search enhancements are pretty good but it requires more rich and organized fertile soil like more enhanced tag system (this is just an example). thus, we would be better to consider about this topic later. suggest me later again. 4: using libraries are welcome. let's refactor and enhance it. when implementing the more sophisticated data visualization, tell me any questions and what you are undecided. 5: export & sharing feature is out of range of this project however, sharing search urls is fascinating. talk about this later. 6: performance optimization is future mission. keep in mind that we'll discuss it after site's functionalities are fulfilled enough. your ideas for enhancement is filled with attraction but, It would be better to discuss your excellent ideas later. there are many tasks that we should do now. lastly, tell me any questions while implementation work.

I'd like to answer questions of implementing advanced analytics dashboard implementation. 1: let's use Chart.js. 2: both. 3: commit frequency. 4: we should fetch live repository stats and show repository languages, contributors, etc. Next, let me tell you about visualization enhancement questions. 1: yes. should be interactive. 2: yes. should update in real-time. Finally, I'll tell implementation policy. 1: I do not have github token/api access set up. all repositories that summary exist should be track. Permission should be read-only. 2: you should implement analytics dashboard first. and I want you to analyze my existing HTML files. 3: let's implement pagination with simple page numbers. I believe 10 items per page would be nice. 4: click to filter is not required at least now. And drill-down capabilities seems incredible. let's implement it. after you would have accomplished implementation work, I'd like to discuss about refactoring. please remember that. finaly, tell me any questions while implementation work and share every notices while thinking process.

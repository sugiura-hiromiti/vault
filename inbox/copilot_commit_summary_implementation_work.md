first, let me explain this repository. this repository has collection of commit summary which is of my github repositories. each commit summary is generated for certain range of commit history of the repository. each html files in the doc/ are a summary one by one. this repository has remote repository on github. we use github pages to deploy our summaries. index.html is the entrypoint of the deployed web page. index.html should be a powerful search hub and dashboard of statistics. Currently, there is no index.html. I've made requirements definition document. the file name is RDD.md. and I've also made techinology selection document. the file name is technology_selection.md. now, read the eintire repository. then start Implementation. you should follow RDD.md and technology_selection.md. If there are ambiguous point or question, ask me everything

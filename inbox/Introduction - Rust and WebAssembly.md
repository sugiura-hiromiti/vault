This small book describes how to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) together.

This book is for anyone interested in compiling Rust to WebAssembly for fast, reliable code on the Web. You should know some Rust, and be familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You don't need to be an expert in any of them.

Don't know Rust yet? [Start with *The Rust Programming Language* first.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

Don't know JavaScript, HTML, or CSS? [Learn about them on MDN.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

You should read [the motivation for using Rust and WebAssembly together](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/why-rust-and-webassembly.html), as well as familiarize yourself with the [background and concepts](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/background-and-concepts.html) first.

The [tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/introduction.html) is written to be read from start to finish. You should follow along: writing, compiling, and running the tutorial's code yourself. If you haven't used Rust and WebAssembly together before, do the tutorial!

The [reference sections](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/index.html) may be perused in any order.

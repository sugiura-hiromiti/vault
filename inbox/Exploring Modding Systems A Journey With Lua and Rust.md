In the ever-evolving world of game development, modding has become a powerful way to enhance gameplay experiences and breathe new life into existing titles. It allows creators and players to bring their unique ideas to life, enriching the gaming ecosystem with fresh content and endless possibilities. As developers, we‚Äôre always looking for innovative ways to build and support modding systems that are both efficient and user-friendly. Today, we embark on a captivating journey to explore the synergy between two remarkable technologies, Lua and Rust, as we delve into the realm of modding systems.

Lua, a lightweight and versatile scripting language, has long been a popular choice for game developers to implement modding support. Its flexibility and ease of use make it an ideal candidate for extending game functionality and allowing user-generated content. On the other hand, Rust, a systems programming language focused on safety and performance, has quickly gained momentum for its powerful features and impressive capabilities. By combining the best of both worlds, we set out to create a robust, yet accessible modding system that opens the door to endless creativity.

Join us as we experiment with the unique strengths of Lua and Rust, sharing our insights, challenges, and triumphs along the way. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or just starting your journey in game development, this adventure promises to be an exciting exploration of modding systems and the potential of Lua and Rust.

## Making a cargo project and integrating Lua

Let‚Äôs embark on this journey by creating a new Cargo project and setting up a simple Lua script.

First, create a new Cargo project and navigate to the project directory:

```hs
cargo new modding-example && cd modding-example
```

Next, add the `rlua` crate to your project:

```hs
cargo add rlua
```

Now, let‚Äôs create a `main.rs` file with the following code to execute a Lua script:

```hs
// File: src/main.rs
use rlua::{Lua, Result};
use std::fs;

fn exec_lua_code() -> Result<()> {
    let lua_code = fs::read_to_string("game/main.lua").expect("Unable to read the Lua script");

    let lua = Lua::new();
    lua.context(|lua_ctx| {
        lua_ctx.load(&lua_code).exec()?;

        Ok(())
    })
}

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    exec_lua_code()
}
```

If we try to run this, we‚Äôll notice that the script can‚Äôt execute because the `game/main.lua` file doesn't exist yet. Let's create the necessary directory and file:

```hs
mkdir game
touch game/main.lua
```

Now, let‚Äôs add some flair to our Lua script by printing some information:

```hs
-- File: game/main.lua
print(_VERSION)
print("üåô Lua is working!")
```

With this setup, you should see the Lua version and the ‚ÄúLua is working!‚Äù message printed to the console when you run your Rust program.

## Making the Stdout More Interesting

Our texts look plain and we can‚Äôt differentiate between lua outputs and rust outputs. Let‚Äôs change that, by utilizing colors from the popular `colored` crate.

First, let‚Äôs add `colored` crate to our project:

```hs
cargo add colored
```

Now let‚Äôs re-implement Lua‚Äôs `print` statement with our own.

```hs
-- File: game/main.lua

function print(...)
  local args = {...}
  
  for _, arg in ipairs(args) do
    if type(arg) == "table" then
      __rust_bindings_print(tostring(arg))
    elseif type(arg) == "string" then
      __rust_bindings_print(arg)
    else
      __rust_bindings_print(tostring(arg))
    end
  end
end

-- rest of game/main.lua
```

Now, we need to pass `__rust_bindings_print` to the lua context, so it calls our `rust` code. We are also going to create a `log` function for our `rust` runtime:

```hs
// File: src/main.rs
use rlua::{Lua, Result};
use std::fs;

mod logger;

/* rest of main.rs */
```

And now we must create this file:

```hs
touch src/logger.rs
```

Finally, we can implement the colorized output:

```hs
// File: src/logger.rs
use colored::*;
use rlua::{Result, Value};
use std::io::Write;

pub fn lua_print<'lua>(lua_ctx: rlua::Context<'lua>, value: Value<'lua>) -> Result<()> {
    let mut str = String::from("nil");
    if let Some(lua_str) = lua_ctx.coerce_string(value)? {
        str = lua_str.to_str()?.to_string();
    }

    match writeln!(std::io::stdout(), "[{}] {}", "lua".cyan(), str) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(()),
        Err(e) => Err(rlua::Error::external(e)),
    }
}

pub fn log(message: &str) {
    println!("[{}] {}", "rust".red(), message);
}
```

Now we can utilize these functions in our `src/main.rs`

```hs
// File: src/main.rs
use logger::{log, lua_print}; // new line
// rest of use statements

// ...

fn exec_lua_code() -> Result<()> {
    let lua_code = fs::read_to_string("game/main.lua").expect("Unable to read the Lua script");
    
    let lua = Lua::new();
    lua.context(|lua_ctx| {
        log("üîß Loading Lua bindings");
        lua_ctx
            .globals()
            .set("__rust_bindings_print", lua_ctx.create_function(lua_print)?)?;        
        lua_ctx.load(&lua_code).exec()?;

        Ok(())
    })
}

// ...
```

Our colorized output now works! And now we can easily differentiate between our `rust` and `lua` runtime.

Working colorized output

## Making the mods structure

Let‚Äôs think for a second about what our mods will look like.

What comes to mind is the following structure:

```hs
/game
|--/mods
  |--/base
  |----mod.json
  |----mod.lua
  |--/dlc
  |----mod.json
  |----mod.lua
|--main.lua
```

The `.json` file will have the following schema:

```hs
{
  "name": "base",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A mod for the base game.",
  "author": "Stefan Kupresak"
}
```

## Loading mods in Rust

Similar to how we created the `logger` module, we are going to create a `mods` rust module now:

```hs
touch src/mods.rs
```

And add a reference to it in our `main.rs`

```hs
// File: src/main.rs
mod mods;
```

For this module, we‚Äôll also need to pull in some new cargo dependencies for helping us parse the mod `json` manifest files:

```hs
cargo add serde_json
```

And for `serde` we‚Äôre going to manually add it to `Cargo.toml`

```hs
[dependecies]
...
serde = { version = "*", features = ["derive"] }
```

Now, we can implement the `mods.rs` module:

```hs
// File: src/mods.rs
use std::fs;
use rlua::{MetaMethod, UserData, UserDataMethods};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Mod {
    pub name: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub author: String,
}

/**
 * UserData is used from rlua so 
 * we can pass the Vec<Mod> to our 
 * Lua context
**/
impl UserData for Mod {}

/**
 * This helps us later to convert
 * the mods struct to a lua table
**/
pub fn items_to_lua_table<'lua>(lua_ctx: &Context<'lua>, items: Vec<Mod>) -> Result<Table<'lua>> {
    let table = lua_ctx.create_table()?;
    for (i, item) in items.iter().enumerate() {
        // lua tables start from index 1 :)
        // see: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/why-do-lua-arrays-tables-start-at-1-instead-of-0
        table.set(i + 1, item.clone())?;
    }
    Ok(table)
}

fn list_mods_root() -> Vec<String> {
    let mut mods = vec![];

    for entry in fs::read_dir("game/mods").expect("Unable to read the mods directory") {
        let entry = entry.expect("Unable to read the mods directory");
        let path = entry.path();

        if path.is_dir() {
            let mod_json_path = path.join("mod.json");
            if mod_json_path.exists() {
                mods.push(mod_json_path.to_str().unwrap().to_string());
            }
        }
    }

    mods
}

pub fn load() -> Vec<Mod> {
    let mod_paths = list_mods_root();
    let mut mods = vec![];

    for mod_json_path in mod_paths {
        let mod_json = fs::read_to_string(mod_json_path).expect("Unable to read the mod.json file");
        let mod_json = serde_json::from_str(&mod_json).expect("Unable to parse the mod.json file");
        mods.push(mod_json);
    }

    mods
}
```

Exciting! Now we can load the mods from our `main.rs` file.

```hs
// File src/main.rs
fn main() -> Result<()> {
  let mods = mods::load();
  log(format!("Loaded {} mods", mods.len()).as_str());
  exec_lua_code();
}
```

Now we should have the following output:

```hs
[rust] Loaded 2 mods
[rust] üîß Loading Lua bindings
[lua] Lua 5.4
[lua] üåô Lua is working!
```

Keep in mind that our `game/` directory looks like this:

How our current game directory looks

## Passing our mods vector to Lua

So far so good. Finally, we need to pass our vector to `lua` and start building out the ‚Äúframework‚Äù for loading these mods.

First, let‚Äôs pass our mods to our `exec_lua_code` function:

```hs
// File src/main.rs
fn exec_lua_code(mods: Vec<Mod>) -> Result<()> {
  /* function body */
}

fn main() -> Result<()> {
  let mods = mods::load();
  /* ... */
  exec_lua_code(mods)
}
```

Now we can pass along our struct to the Lua context:

```hs
// File src/main.rs
fn exec_lua_code(mods: Vec<Mod>) -> Result<()> {
  /* ... */
  lua.context(|lua_ctx| {
    /* ... */
    let mods_table = mods::items_to_lua_table(&lua_ctx, mods)?;
    lua_ctx.globals().set("mods", mods_table)?;
    /* ... */
  })
}
```

We can verify it works by doing the following in our `main.lua`

```hs
print("number of mods -> " .. #mods)
```

## UserData and Lua

One strange thing though, is if we try to access a particular mod, we get this `userdata` construct.

```hs
print("first mod: ", mods[1]) -- userdata 0x5587a65d49e8
```

This is a special construct in lua, which points to a block of raw memory. What‚Äôs interesting is that we can‚Äôt access it as a table in the way you expect:

```hs
print("first mod name: ", mods[1].name) -- throws an error
```

The reason this happens is because `lua` doesn‚Äôt know how to index this data structure. In order to make it indexable‚Äù we have to implement the `__index` function in its meta table.

`rlua` adds a convenient way for us to do so. By implementing the `UserData` trait we can extend this user data and add this metamethod which will allow us to index this data in Lua:

```hs
// File: src/mods.rs
impl UserData for Mod {
    fn add_methods<'lua, M: UserDataMethods<'lua, Self>>(methods: &mut M) {
        methods.add_meta_method(MetaMethod::Index, |_, modd: &Mod, key: String| {
            match key.as_str() {
                "name" => Ok(modd.name.clone()),
                "version" => Ok(modd.version.clone()),
                "description" => Ok(modd.description.clone()),
                "author" => Ok(modd.author.clone()),
                _ => Err(rlua::Error::external(format!("Unknown key: {}", key))),
            }
        })
    }
}
```

Now if we try the same line again, it simply works!

```hs
print("first mod name: ", mods[1].name)
```
```hs
[lua] first mod name: 
[lua] base
```

## Building out a small Lua game framework

With the rust part completed, we can now extend the Lua script and make a few `mod.lua` files to play around with our new system.

In this system, I‚Äôve decided to have a single `mod.lua` entry file for each mod and force it to be a module.

```hs
-- File: game/main.lua

-- rest of main.lua file

Game = {}
function Game:new()
  o = {}
  self.__index = self
  return setmetatable(o, self)
end

function Game:load()
  -- Starts loading the game
  print("‚ö° Loading game")

  -- Load the game mods
  print("üöß Loading " .. #mods .. " mod(s)")

  for _, mod in ipairs(mods) do
    print("‚úÖ Loading mod " .. mod.name)
    local f, err = loadfile("game/mods/" .. mod.name .. "/mod.lua")

    if f then
      m = f()

      if m and m.init then
        m:init(mod)
      else
        print("‚ùå Mod " .. mod.name .. " does not have an init function")
      end
    else
      print("‚ùå Mod " .. mod.name .. " failed to load: " .. err)
    end
  end
end

game = Game:new()
game:load()
```

Keep in mind this example works with the following `game/mods/base/mod.lua` file

```hs
-- File: game/mods/base/mod.lua
mod = {}

function mod:init(mod) 
  print("üïπÔ∏è Initializing mod " .. mod.name)
end

return mod
```

Will produce:

```hs
‚ûú cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.01s
     Running \`target/debug/modding-example\`
[rust] üîß Loading Lua bindings
[rust] üöÄ executing lua script
[lua] ‚ö° Loading game
[lua] üöß Loading 2 mod(s)
[lua] ‚úÖ Loading mod base
[lua] üïπÔ∏è Initializing mod base
[lua] ‚úÖ Loading mod dlc
[lua] ‚ùå Mod dlc does not have an init function
```

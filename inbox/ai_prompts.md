# poc

this directory is where poc stuffs are put. the main purpose of poc is experiment our ideas and checks they are archivable, then get feedback before starting product implementation. To get
  back feedback, notes them to feedback.md and reflect it to todo file in parent directory.
this is poc directory thus, you don't have to worry about code cleanliness. just focus on making things that's just work. only checking how should we implement and archive milestone is concerned.

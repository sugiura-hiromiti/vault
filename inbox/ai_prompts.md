# poc

this branch(worktree) is where poc stuffs are put. the main purpose of poc is experiment our ideas and checks they are archivable, then get feedback before starting product implementation. To get
  back well feedback, notes them to feedback.md.
this is poc directory thus, just focus on making things that's just work. though only checking how should we implement and archive milestone is concerned, always keep in mind the big picture (requirement.md, design_principles.md, v0.1_TODOS.md) in order to notice unexpectation and take back good feedback.

current status is, XXX have been established. now we XXX.

report what you've done, what you haven't and anything else questions. I will review how actually proceed to proof our milestone is accomplishable

# product

now, we've completed poc stage. we shall start real implementation of v0.1 Milestone XXX. in contrast to poc stage, code cleanliness and well architectured codebase is priority 1 concerns. let's refactor POC codes into real product.

# poc

this branch is where poc stuffs are put. the main purpose of poc is experiment our ideas and checks they are archivable, then get feedback before starting product implementation. To get
  back well feedback, notes them to feedback.md.
this is poc directory thus, you don't have to worry about code cleanliness. just focus on making things that's just work. though only checking how should we implement and archive milestone is concerned, always keep in mind the big picture in order to notice unexpectation and take back good feedback.

current status is, XXX have been established. now we XXX.

# poc iteration

report what you've done, what you haven't and anything else questions. I will review how actually proceed to proof our milestone is accomplishable
